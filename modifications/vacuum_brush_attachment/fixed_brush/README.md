# Brush attachment for the vacuum funnel
These parts allow for attaching a brush to the vacuum funnel to catch as much of the dust as possible.

The brush holder is attached to the vacuum funnel with 4 M3 screws with at least 20mm length (better ~30mm) to allow for removing the brush if it isn't required.

This design is not great and should probably not be used for various reasons:
- The brush extends a fixed distance down, which means the bristles get squished, especially when using a short cutting tool. This introduces a lot of friction, as well as bending the bristles so they don't catch as much dust.
- The brush has to be removed for a toolchange, which can be quite tedious.
- The brush strip I designed this for was very annoying to work with, both in terms of bending it into the desired shape and glueing it into the printed part.

I attempted to address this issues with the [moving brush design](../moving_brush), which uses 200mm MGN12H rails to slide the dust shoe up and down.

## Part descriptions
### VACUUM_FUNNEL_CUSTOM
A slight modification of the default VACUUM FUNNEL part. 4 holes were added around the bottom to mount the brush holder to. You might want to close these holes with bolts (or hot glue) if you want to use it without the brush (for maximum vaccum power!).

### VACUUM_FUNNEL_BRUSH_HOLDER
The part which holds the brush. It has a slot which is 6mm wide and 10mm deep and can hold the common brush strips, which are 5mm wide. The brush strip should be glued into the slot, since it is an intentionally loose fit.
After the glue has hardened, you will want to drill through the mounting holes into the fabric part of the strip to open up a path for the screws.
