# Universal mounting plate
This part is my base solution to mount different things to the vertical slider. It is mounted in place of the router bracket and contains several mounting solutions.

There is a 3x3 grid of holes, where an M5 hex nut can be pressed into (and glued in place if necessary). The grid spacing is 25mm.

Left and right of the grid's center column are two slots which hold M5 nuts that can slide up and down. The slots are 25mm apart and allow for more flexible but less repeatable attaching of parts. The slots can be plugged by gluing the slot plug on top, or simply with hotglue.

The slots have an included sacrificial layer to allow the plate to be printed face-down. After printing, simply remove the bridging layer from the slot. If some debris remains, inserting a nut and sliding it around a few times inside the slot should clean it up.

## Part descriptions
### universal_plate
The mounting plate itself as described above.
### universal_plate_slot_plug
A simple part that can plug the holes of the slots to prevent nuts falling out. Optional, as the same can be accomplished with hotglue.
