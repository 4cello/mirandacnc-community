# Rail endstop with limit switch mount
When building the geared version with HTD belts, this part can be used instead of the default endstops.

The part features a mounting slot to hold widely available 20x10x6mm microswitches. 
M2.5 nuts can be inserted into openings and pushed into the slots to firmly secure the switch in place.
I used M2.5x14mm screws, since they fit through the holes in my microswitches and are short enough to not poke out of the backside.

The endstop is mounted directly to the aluminium profile like the original part, but the location of the mounting holes is different.

Currently, the endstop can't be used with the GT2 version of the CNC machine because it has no belt mounting attachment. 
If anybody gets around to add the teeth, please share your files!
