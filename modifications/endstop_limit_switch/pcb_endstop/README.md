# Rail endstop with limit switch mount
When building the geared version with HTD belts, this part can be used instead of the default endstops.

The part can hold PCB mounted limit switches, like [these](https://www.ebay.com/itm/10X-Mechanical-End-Stop-Endstop-Limit-Switch-CNC-3D-Printer-RAMPS-1-4-Arduino-/363454474395) or [these](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32789789727.html).

Currently, the endstop can't be used with the GT2 version of the CNC machine because it has no belt mounting attachment. 
If anybody gets around to add the teeth, please share your files!
