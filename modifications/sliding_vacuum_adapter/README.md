# Sliding vacuum adapter
Adds a vacuum connection that can slide up and down independently of the Z axis.
It mounts to the side of the carriage.

The design is heavily inspired by Ivan's smaller CNC machine, as seen in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ctyLjOHg7Ag?t=791).

This is not finished, and I probably won't continue to design this, because I attached my Y axis motors to the inside of the sideplates to save footprint, but this first design iteration collides with the motors.

I tried a test cut, but only mounted this part with double sided tape, which introduced a little to much flex, but worked in principle.
