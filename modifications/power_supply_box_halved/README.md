# Power Supply Box (Halved)
Due to its prodigious size (30cm long), the provided power supply box can be challenging to fit on a printer's bed.
To make it easier to print, the box was split in halves, which should fit on most printers.

The parts are mostly symmetrical so they can exchanged easily. For a full box, you need a combination of the following:
 - 2x PSBOX_HALF
 - 2x PSBOX_HALF_CABLE_HOLE
 - 1x PSBOX_COVER_CUTOUTS
 - 3x any combination of PSBOX_COVER_BLANK and PSBOX_COVER_LOGO
 
The halves of the box itself can be connected with M3x22 screws, which are already on the BOM, since you probably bought spares.
M3 nuts can be used to further tighten the assembly. The shape of the cut should make it easier to align the halves.

The covers snap together with a dovetail, but if you find the connection to be to flimsy, you could connect them with glue, 
filament welding (with a soldering iron or 3D pen) or simply with adhesive tape on the inside.

The mounting holes are compatible with the original power supply box.
