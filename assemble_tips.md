# MirandaCNC Assembly Tips
## Belt Tensioners
X axis:
- Install tensioner on left side (away from carriage motor), so the belt bearings don't crash into it.
- Doesn't require an extra belt tensioner, since screw goes through left carriage instead.

Y axis:
- Move tensioners as far back as possible, to prevent x axis crashing into it.

## Endstops
- Use GT2 belt clip thingys as endstops only, no belts attached.
- There are custom endstops available, where limit switches can be attached to. 
    However, this version doesn't have a belt clip (yet?), so it is only suitable for the HTD 5M version.
